COMMAND: 
    In the folder containing ParaCFG.class, execute:
    $ java ParaCFG [OPTION] INPUTFILE [OUTPUTFILE]
    
    Available options: 
        --rings : if the graph is rings connected to a node
        --generic: for general graphs 
    If no option is specified, then it is assumed to be generic.

    If no output file is specified, then the output file will be [INPUTFILE].[timestamp] and is located in the same folder as INPUTFILE

FILE FORMAT:
    For generic input files, the first line contains only one integer which is the size of the graph. The second line contains the initial configuration, that is the initial number of tokens at each node, separated by spaces. The rest of the file contains the adjacency matrix of the graph, each line is a row of the matrix.
    For rings connected to a node, since the graph structure is known, only the initial configuration is needed. Each line of the input file corresponds to the configuration of a part of the graph: the first line is the center node, each of the other lines corresponds to a ring. The neighbors of the center node are the first nodes of the rings.
    Examples:
        - file 'star-3.txt' corresponds to a star with a for nodes;
        - file 'ring-4_3.txt' corresponds to a node connected to a ring of 4 nodes and a ring of 3 nodes.
